# Playstation 5 DualSense Wireless-Controller X-Plane .joy-File

Add both files to XPLANE/Resources/joystick configs/ and you should be able to visually configure the controller (either connected via Bluetooth or USB).

I have setup some default assignments which I like the most. Note that the Mic-Mute Button can be used when connected via USB. Uncomment the "Button 14"-Settings in the joy-File.

## Important:
Note that it was setup to work on an Apple Mac! It would have to be adapted for other operating systems as the axis and button numbers might differ.

See also [Developer Documentation](https://developer.x-plane.com/article/creating-joystick-configuration-joy-files/) and [https://feedback.x-plane.com/posts/1430/ps4-ps5-controller-support](https://feedback.x-plane.com/posts/1430/ps4-ps5-controller-support)

As of XPlane 11 such a file is not present yet. Maybe they want to add something for X-Plane 12.
